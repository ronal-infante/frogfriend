# Procedural Miro ðŸ¤– 
This repo hosts a custom app that uses Miro's Web SDK and the Unsplash API as part of an experiement as part of frog Design's virtual studio for Austin Design Week 2021. The app runs various randomized tasks on a loop to emulate the sensation of collaborating with someone in a digital file.

See the app live:

>### ***To collaborate is to let go.***
>
>**Background**
>When one brainstorms on a digital stage like Miro, you give your collaborator the license to interpret your idea, to give it new meaning, to get inspired and evolve it, even.
>
>Almost immediately, the precious image reserved in your head matures, as no two brains will process information identically.
>
>We are a product of our unique environments and experiences and as such, are inherently biased by our thoughts. It's almost a guarantee that an idea will morph upon sharing it.
>
>Collaboration is both beautiful and anxiety-inducing. It's an uncomfortable, self-conscious actâ€”a soreness you build muscle for. That is what triggered this experiment. 
>
>**Instructions**
>Drop something meaningful here and let it go.
