        <p>When one brainstorms on a digital stage like Miro, you give a collaborator the license to interpret your idea, to give it new meaning, to get inspired and evolve it, even. Almost immediately, the precious image reserved in your head matures, as no two brains will process information identically. We are a product of our unique environments and experiences and as such, are inherently biased by our thoughts. It's almost a guarantee that an idea will morph upon sharing it. Collaboration is both beautiful and anxiety-inducing. It's an uncomfortable, self-conscious act--a soreness you build muscle for. That is what triggered this experiment.
