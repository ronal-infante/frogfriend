        <p>To collaborate is to let go. When one brainstorms on a digital stage like Miro, you give a collaborator the license to interpret your idea, to give it new meaning, to get inspired and evolve it, even. Almost immediately, the precious image you reserved in your head matures as no two brains will process information identically. We are a product of our unique environments and experiences and as such, are inherantly biased by our thoughts. It's almost a guarantee that your idea will not retain it's original form as you share it. Collaboration is both beautiful and anxiety-inducing. It's an uncomfortable, self-conscious act--a soreness you build muscle for. That is what triggered this experiment.
